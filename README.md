# PseudoSpectral-method-for-optimal-control
Pseudo-spectral motion planning for UGVs and UAVs with obstacle avoidance. Explores P-norm, normalized P-norm, and soft constraints for clustered obstacles. Extends to point-mass and 3-DOF UAVs, validated via dynamics and differential flatness, with trajectories simulated using RK45.
